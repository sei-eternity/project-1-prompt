### How it solved for the winner

I initialize the process by two for loop the first loop check on the horizontal cells of the table, the loop goes through a condition that try to find tha mathches on each row, the other loop work as same as the first loop but it goes through a condition that try to find the matches in the table columns, and for the cross lines that can a player achieve a win through i initialize two condition to check if it is on the same line or not.
